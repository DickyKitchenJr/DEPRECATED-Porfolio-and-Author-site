        <p class="book-blurb">Get to know a new kind of serial killer in this psychological thriller that will have you guessing until the last page!<br><br>
          What drives an average man to kill? To violently plot the taking of a life? What drives The Average Man to murder?<br><br>
          That’s what The Tall Man finds himself asking as he sits across from a murderer awaiting trial. Requested personally for this interview, The Tall Man sits with no means to record the interaction, and listens as The Average Man recounts his crimes. As the tale unfolds, The Tall Man finds that there’s far more darkness to the killer than he ever could have imagined.<br><br>       
         Tensions rise, and The Tall man listens as The Average Man confesses to more than just the murders he’s on trial for. But what is the killer’s purpose behind these confessions, and will The Tall Man survive as a far more horrifying tale unravels before him?<br><br>
         Can The Tall Man piece everything together and ensure the killer pays for his crimes? Or will he become the next prey?<br><br>
         Author Dicky Kitchen Jr. offers a tantalizing psychological thriller that will have readers caught with bated breaths. For by the end, it will come to light that not everyone is what they seem…
