        <p class="book_title">Prey/Pray: Hunting Party - The Kid</p><br>

        <p>
            A light rain drizzled down as they drove. <br><br>
“So, how’s your latest project coming along son?” his dad asked, glacing over his shoulder from the driver’s seat.<br><br>
“It’s going ok dad. I’m working on a new game.” He replied. <br><br>
But it wasn’t him. It was his voice, but something was wrong. <br><br>
“Focus on the road honey.” His mother said. <br><br>
“Don’t worry, the rain isn’t that bad. I’ve got this.” His father replied, looking back at the road.<br><br>
“Yeah mom, dads got this” he began to say, but was cut off by his father’s booming voice.<br><br>
“WHAT ARE THEY DOING??? LOOK OUT!!!”<br><br>
A violent force paired with a deafening boom rocked the car, and for a moment time ceased to exist.<br><br>
In that moment, he was able to take in everything around him. <br><br>
His father’s hands clenched around the steering wheel. <br><br>
His mother’s arms thrown up defensively, as if their presence could stop what was to come.<br><br>
And the odd realization that what was once the direction the car was facing, was now located out the passenger window.<br><br>
As the car twisted perpendicular to the road, time unfroze, and the tires lost contact with the ground.<br><br>
Friction is a funny thing. Apply friction to tires straight on, and they roll. However, apply the same friction to the side of the tire, and they can cause a 3000-pound car to flip.<br><br>
The once peaceful inside of the car became a violent arena where everything around them attacked the passengers with each slam against the concrete.<br><br>
Images blurred as his body was tossed in every direction, the seatbelt the only thing keeping him under any semblance of control. The ceiling and sides of the car inched closer to him with every impact, and he heard the screams of his parents.<br><br>
With a final thud, the car finally stopped it’s tumbling, and came to rest upside down.<br><br>
Disoriented and feeling woozy, he began to look around.<br><br>
He felt something warm running down his face, up to his head, and he looked to the driver’s side of the car.<br><br>
He saw his father looking back at him.<br><br>
“Dad, I don’t feel right.” He said, as his world began to close in on him.<br><br>
But his dad just stared back, eyes unblinking and unfocused.<br><br>
“Dad?” he meekly said, as a dark circle overtook the periphery of his vision.<br><br>
It was then that he noticed blood coming from his dad’s ear, dripping onto the ceiling of the car.<br><br>
It was the last thing he saw before the whole world went dark.<br><br>
</p>

<p class="center">****</p><br><br>

<p>
He gasps as he shoots forward in the seat, the seatbelt yanking him back as his palms slam against the glovebox in front of him.<br><br>
“Geez!” the driver shouts.<br><br>
“Kid, are you ok?” she says, recovering from the shock of the boy’s sudden motion.<br><br>
He looks around, eyes wide in horror, and realizes he was dreaming.<br><br>
“Kid. It’s ok. You’re ok.” She says, reaching out and touching his arm.<br><br>
His pulse calms and he glances down at her hand.<br><br>
“Yeah. I’m ok. Sorry. I didn’t mean to startle you.” He says.<br><br>
“Was it the dream again?” she asks.<br><br>
“Yeah.” He replies, looking down, wiping the moisture from his eyes.<br><br>
“Hey, it’s ok. We’re almost there, but if you need me to, I’ll pull over for a minute. We don’t have to keep driving. We’re making good time.” She says, looking concerned.<br><br> 
“No. Let’s just keep going. I’m ok. Sorry. I didn’t mean to doze off. I’m good now. Honest. Let’s just keep going.” He nods, taking a deep breath and exhaling.<br><br> 
“Are you sure Kid?”<br><br>
“Yeah, I’m sure. Let’s get this done, so you can stop calling me Kid.”<br><br>
She smiles. “You know the rules, no names when we’re working.”<br><br>
“I guess that’s one way to look at what we’re doing.” He says, cocking an eyebrow.<br><br>
“You like his way of viewing it better?”<br><br>
“Maybe. It definitely sounds cooler. Don’t you think so Nurse?” he says with an edge of sarcasm to the name Nurse.<br><br> 
“Ok Kid,” she mockingly emphasizes as he did, “have it your way. No names while we’re <span class="italics">hunting</span>.”<br><br>
