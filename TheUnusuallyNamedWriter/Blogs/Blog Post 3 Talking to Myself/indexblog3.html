            It took 17 years to write and self-publish my first book. What stated as a short piece of writing in 2003, would become the second chapter in my 2020 debut novel <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Prey-Pray-Origin-Average-Man/dp/1734933801/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=prey%2Fpray&qid=1617066908&sr=8-1">Prey/Pray: Origin of The Average Man.</a> <br><br>
Looking back on that time, I’d love to say it took so long to complete because I regularly worked on it and tweaked the book, searching for perfection in the story over those 17 years. But in reality, I spent the time dragging my feet and ignoring the voice in my head telling me to finish writing the story.<br><br> 
In truth, I never wrote the story intending to publish it. As well received as the book has been, it was only originally meant to be written for my entertainment and maybe to share with a friend or two. I didn’t even have the idea to publish it until I completed the story, which made marketing the book a much slower and more painful process, but that’s a discussion for another day.<br><br> 
Thinking about it now, I wonder what I would tell my younger self about the book and the process. What would my 40-year-old self tell my 22-year-old self one year after having published my first book and having had the time to look back on everything? Let’s find out…<br>
<br>

<span class="young">22 (me from 2003):</span> Hmm… This is different… What’s going on? Where am I? Why is everything so dark?<br><br>

<span class="now">40 (me now, 2021):</span> Hey.<br><br>

<span class="young">22:</span> **startled, throws a fast punch**<br><br>

THUD<br><br>

<span class="now">40:</span> OW!<br><br>

<span class="young">22:</span> I don’t know who you are, but you’ve got less than a second to explain!<br><br>

<span class="now">40:</span> Geez I was fast back then **rubs jaw**<br><br>

<span class="young">22:</span> Start making sense, or start getting hurt. Your choice.<br><br>

<span class="now">40:</span> Calm down. I’m you, stupid. <br><br>

<span class="young">22:</span> No, I’m me. You’re some old guy that’s about to get hit again.<br><br> 

<span class="now">40:</span> I’m you from the future. 18 years from now. <br><br>

<span class="young">22:</span> **looks 40 over** Uh, no. Not buying it. Maybe I hit you too hard. Are you so soft that one hit made you stupid, or is that your default setting?<br><br>

<span class="now">40:</span> **rubs face in frustration** I should have really thought this out better. An introduction at a distance would have been safer. It’s not like I was less sarcastic at 22 years old. Ugh. I am you.<br><br> 

<span class="young">22:</span> Nope. Time to hit you again.<br><br>

<span class="now">40:</span> **throws hands up defensively** Just listen for a second. We’re never going to get through this at this rate. Our name is Dicky Kitchen Jr, our favorite drink is tea, our best friend is a guy that’s fought us more times than any enemy, and we have a scar on our right middle finger from hot poisonous wax gluing our fingers together when we were young. **holds up right middle finger**<br><br>

<span class="young">22:</span> **cautiously inspects both his and 40’s middle finger** Ok… Anyone could have a scar like that though.<br><br>

<span class="now">40:</span> And the other stuff I mentioned?<br><br>

<span class="young">22:</span> I don’t know, maybe you’ve just been watching me.<br><br> 

<span class="now">40:</span> Look, you have other scars and more personal stuff I could say, but we’re going to share this with other people so it’s probably best to not over share.<br><br> 

<span class="young">22:</span> Other people? Since when do we share personal stuff with other people?<br><br>

<span class="now">40:</span> It’s a recent development, and honestly still a work in progress. It’s taken you a while. I don’t think I need to explain to you why.<br><br>

<span class="young">22:</span> **relaxes some** Yeah, ok, you’re probably me. But you understand why I didn’t believe you, right? I mean, not only is this nuts, but… **waves a hand at every part of 40**<br><br>

<span class="now">40:</span> **shrugs** Yeah, there’s work to be done.<br><br> 

<span class="young">22:</span> And the hair. Since when do we have hair?<br><br>

<span class="now">40:</span> On and off for the last 5 or so years.<br><br>

<span class="young">22:</span> Why?<br><br>

<span class="now">40:</span> Got bored.<br><br> 

<span class="young">22:</span> **thinks it over** Ok, I can see that happening.<br><br>

<span class="now">40:</span> Listen, we need to get on track here. People reading this conversation aren’t here for existential weirdness. We’re here to talk about what we wrote.<br><br> 

<span class="young">22:</span> What we wrote? You mean what I just wrote tonight?<br><br>

<span class="now">40:</span> Yep. That’s the one. Let’s see, what did we call it back then?... Diary of a Serial Killer?<br><br>

<span class="young">22:</span> Yeah. I just wrote that. Not sure I’m sold on the title. Something about it doesn’t work.<br><br> 

<span class="now">40:</span> We’ll change it a few times before it’s done.<br><br>

<span class="young">22:</span> Done? Wait, does that mean I actually finish writing the story?<br><br>

<span class="now">40:</span> Yeah, we finally finish one of the stories we start.<br><br> 

<span class="young">22:</span> That’s great! How long did it take to finish?<br><br>

<span class="now">40:</span> 17 years.<br><br> 

<span class="young">22:</span> Geez! Why so long?<br><br>

<span class="now">40:</span> A few things got in our way. We focused on other things in life, we didn’t believe we could actually finish it, and in a few years you’re going to hear about a show called ‘Dexter’ and think the premise of the show is too similar to what you have in mind for the story. You’ll actually go out of your way to never watch the show, just to make sure no one can accuse you of copying the idea.<br><br> 

<span class="young">22:</span> Ok, well now that I know all of that, I can change it right? I can just go back and work on it more right away. Or did it suck and I shouldn’t bother?<br><br>

<span class="now">40:</span> No, actually it turned out great. It’s getting fantastic reviews. But, no, you can’t go back and change anything. That’s not how these sorts of things work. Changing the future would prevent you from ever having this conversation, and so you’d never change the future. Besides, you’ll forget all of this when you go back to your time.<br><br> 

<span class="young">22:</span> Why?<br><br>

<span class="now">40:</span> **shrugs** It’s the only way any of this makes sense.<br><br> 

<span class="young">22:</span> Fair point.<br><br> 

<span class="now">40:</span> Anyway, it’s been a year since you’ve published the book. And like I said, the reviews have been overwhelmingly positive. It’s really been a great experience.<br><br> 

<span class="young">22:</span> That’s crazy. I can’t believe people actually like my writing. I haven’t even given the main character a name yet. What do I end up naming him?<br><br>

<span class="now">40:</span> Um, well, actually… he still doesn’t have a name. None of the important characters in the book do.<br><br> 

<span class="young">22:</span> Damn. Really?<br><br>

<span class="now">40:</span> Yeah, and there’s no cursing in the book either.<br><br> 

<span class="young">22:</span> There’s no cursing?<br><br>

<span class="now">40:</span> Nope.<br><br>

<span class="young">22:</span> In a book about a serial killer?<br><br>

<span class="now">40:</span> Yep.<br><br> 

<span class="young">22:</span> So, you’re telling me I end up writing a story…<br><br>

<span class="now">40:</span> **interrupts** Novel, actually.<br><br> 

<span class="young">22:</span> Ok, so I write a novel about a serial killer where no one has names, and there’s no cursing, and people are actually enjoying it instead of using it to kindle?<br><br>

<span class="now">40:</span> **chuckles** Kindle, that’s funny.<br><br> 

<span class="young">22:</span> Why?<br><br>

<span class="now">40:</span> You wouldn’t get it. Consider it a future joke.<br><br> 

<span class="young">22:</span> Ok.<br><br>

<span class="now">40:</span> But to answer your question, yeah. That’s exactly what you do. There are a couple names in the book, but those are just nods to friends.<br><br> 

<span class="young">22:</span> What about the ending? Do I use the ending I have in mind now?<br><br>

<span class="now">40:</span> You expand on it a little, but yeah, you use the ending.<br><br>

<span class="young">22:</span> **smiles largely** And it works?<br><br> 

<span class="now">40:</span> It blows peoples minds. 99% of readers never see it coming.<br><br> 

<span class="young">22:</span> That’s awesome. So, did some big publisher pick it up or something?<br><br>

<span class="now">40:</span> No, you actually decide to self-publish.<br><br> 

<span class="young">22:</span> You can do that?<br><br>

<span class="now">40:</span> Yeah, it’s actually a pretty big thing in my time. Millions of people choose to self-publish.<br><br> 

<span class="young">22:</span> Why do I do it?<br><br>

<span class="now">40:</span> By the time you decide to publish, you really want full control over the story. Instead of risking a traditional publisher telling you to make changes, you decide to do it all yourself.<br><br> 

<span class="young">22:</span> Was it the right decision?<br><br> 

<span class="now">40:</span> Hard to say at this point. Self-publishing is definitely harder than traditional publishing because of how much you have to do on your own. Marketing is probably easier with traditional publishing, as long as you get a good publisher. And the initial cost of self-publishing is more than you’d expect, but it’s necessary to make sure the book appears professional as the traditionally published alternatives. But on the flip side, you get higher royalties self-publishing and own all the rights to your book and characters. At only a year out from the release date, it’s still too early to say if self-publishing was the best decision.<br><br> 

<span class="young">22:</span> So we’re not famous?<br><br>

<span class="now">40:</span> **chuckles** Nah, not yet. But who knows? It could happen. Getting a book in the hands of readers takes a lot of time and effort. It’s a bit of a never-ending process. And when it really comes down to it, one book alone seldom gets a writer big recognition. Typically, an author has several books written before they really get noticed.<br><br> 

<span class="young">22:</span> So, I have to write more books? You just said it took 17 years just to write the one!!! Great, I’ll be dead before I even write 3 books.<br><br> 

<span class="now">40:</span> Actually, you’ve already published your first 3 books. The one you just started writing inspires you to write a companion book exploring the back stories of the characters created in the first book. You released the first part of that as your second published book, and then you wrote a kid’s book and published it with an author who is also an illustrator.<br><br> 

<span class="young">22:</span> I write a children’s book? That can’t be a good idea. No way did my mind produce a book safe for kids.<br><br> 

<span class="now">30:</span> Actually, it’s a really cute reimagining of Peter Piper. It’s a great book for kids.<br><br> 

<span class="young">22:</span> What possessed me to write a children’s book?<br><br>

<span class="now">40:</span> Our son did. You were teaching him the tongue twister, and it turned into something much sillier.<br><br> 

<span class="young">22:</span> We have a son?!?!?!?!?!? **wobbles and faints**<br><br>

<span class="now">40:</span> Huh… I really should have seen that coming. I never thought I’d be a dad… Oh well, not exactly how I was planning on ending this conversation with myself, but I guess it’s as good as any.<br><br> 

POOF. Back to reality.<br><br> 

I hope you’ve enjoyed watching me talk to myself. What questions would you ask your past self, and how do you think you’d answer?<br>
