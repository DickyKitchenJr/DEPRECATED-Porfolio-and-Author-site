# Porfolio-and-Author-site
 website built to house my porfolio as well as my author website

Intent is to build an interconnected website starting with a landing page that directs the user to choose between coding portfolio or author sections of the site. 
From there the coding portfolio will house the porfolio as well as an About Me section, while the author page will house a blog section and links to books and reviews of the books.
